# Blog

This is a blog site built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Drizzle](https://drizzle./).

## Why build a blog site?

Not only did I want to learn/use Svelte & Drizzle, but I have specific needs when it comes to documentation & blogging.

There are many plans for this project, but as of now it is simply a blog site with a back up GitHub repo (dual purpose: for version control).
